# 🔐 Password Complexity Checker

### 🚀 Task 03 - Prodigy InfoTech Internship (Comillas Negras)

This project is a simple yet effective **Password Complexity Checker** built with Python. It evaluates the strength of a user's password based on multiple criteria and classifies it as **Weak**, **Medium**, or **Strong**. This tool helps users create stronger and more secure passwords.

## 🧠 Features

- Checks password length (Minimum 8 characters)
- Validates presence of:

  - ✅ Digits
  - ✅ Special characters (`!@#$%^&*()_+`, etc.)
- Rates password strength:
  - 🔴 Weak
  - 🟡 Medium
  - 🟢 Strong
- Provides feedback to help improve password quality

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Regular Expressions (`re` module)
- (Optional GUI: Tkinter – if you choose to add it later)
